I've lived at the humane society since I was just a few weeks old, and I've heard stories from all the older dogs about what's beyond the shelter walls, so now I can't wait to see it all for myself! I still have a lot of puppy energy, so would love a home with a big yard that I can run around in, and I would do great in home with another dog that I can continue to learn confidence and boundaries from. I love to play and wrestle with my friends and I enjoy toys of any kind. I do still need some work on my leash manners and general obedience, but I promise I'm a quick learner! After a full day of play I love to snuggle up with me people or in a cozy bed and relax. Please spend some time with me if you think we'd be a great match! I am available for adoption or healthy foster! I have already been examined by a GHS Veterinarian!",

I've lived at the humane society all my life, survived parvo and an upper respiratory infection, and now I'm ready to take on the world! I love playing with other dogs (some say I'm a bit too rough with no manners) and my favorite move is the ear pull. The staff here think I would do well in a home with another dog that can teach me about boundaries and how not to be a bully, whatever that is. I can have the most fun with even the smallest of toys and I sure do love to eat. But most of all I love human attention. I enjoy a good snuggle sesh on the couch, naps in the sun and laying in your lap until both of our legs go numb. I am still learning how to walk on leash, but I get better every day. I am really hoping to find a home of my own soon, so please spend some time with me if you think we'd have lots of fun together! I am available for adoption or healthy foster!",

I just want to spend all my time snuggling up with my people and getting lots of hugs and kisses from all my friends. The shelter environment has been a little stressful for me, so I can't wait until I can be in my own home with a big cozy bed and as many snuggles as I can fit in a day. I also enjoy going on walks and playing fetch in the yard, so I'm the perfect mix of active and lazy! I get along with most of the dogs here but would prefer to meet any potential brothers or sisters before going home with them, just to make sure we're a good fit! If you'd like to get to know me a little better, please spend some time with me today!",

I was abandoned at GHS a few weeks ago, so the staff isn't too sure what my life looked life prior to my arrival, but they have let me know that I will be spoiled and loved from here on out! I'm still adjusting to life in the shelter, and it can be a little overwhelming at times. I can get nervous in my kennel and will bark at things that I'm not too sure about, such as men or other big dogs. I love treats of all kinds so you can earn my trust pretty quickly if you offer me some snacks! I also enjoy playing with toys and sniffing around on all my walks. I get along well with most dogs, but I would prefer to meet any potential siblings before going home with them, to help make the transition easier. Please spend some time with me today if you'd like to get to know me a little better! I am available for adoption or healthy foster! I have already been examined by a GHS veterinarian",

I love meeting new people and playing with all my doggie friends, and when I get really excited I love to show off my sparkling white teefs. I enjoy going for walks, playing with my tennis ball and sprawling out to soak up all the sunshine. I do have a few quirks that I should tell you about , this is hard for me to admit, but I'm told that I can be very selfish. I don't like to share any of my things, especially my food. The staff at GHS have recommended that I be fed in my crate so that I don't have to worry about prying hands (or paws) trying to steal from me, and it is best that I be adopted to a home without young children. I really am the best boy and I hope that these quirks don't scare you away from adopting me. I would love to show you just how sweet and affectionate I can be, so please visit the Adoption Center and spend some time with me today! I am available for adoption or healthy foster!

	    description: "Hi there, my name is Rain. I just arrived at the shelter and it has unfortunately been a very difficult adjustment for me. I prefer the quiet and solitude of my old life, and the shelter is typically buzzing with people and strange sounds at all times. Because I see so many different people every day, it has been hard to figure out who is safe and who I can trust, so I spend most of my day hiding behind a blanket hoping that no one notices me. I think once I am in a home, with a few of the same people every day that I could grow a bond with, I may be able to come out of my shell a little and warm up to some soft pets and affection. If you think you have the patience and love in your heart for a special cat like me, please spend some time with me today. I am available for adoption or healthy foster!
